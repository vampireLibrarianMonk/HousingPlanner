### American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) 7 Design Wind Speed (Licensed)

This layer provides code-grade wind design data when a licensed American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) source is available.
The values are design wind speeds and risk factors used by engineers, not storm history.
Use this to compare structural design expectations across neighborhoods and for insurance discussions.
It is a professional standard and should be interpreted alongside local building practices.

- **Design wind speed (MRI 700/300):** {design_speed}
- **Risk category:** {risk_category}
- **Standard:** {standard}
- **Hurricane-prone region:** {hurricane_prone}

ASCE data is **design-level** and requires a licensed API token.
