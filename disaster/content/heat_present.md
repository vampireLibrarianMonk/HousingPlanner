### Heat Risk (Screening Level)

This layer summarizes current and recent heat risk near the home.
The data comes from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) / National Weather Service (NWS) HeatRisk categories plus recent advisory records.
Use this to compare relative heat stress exposure and plan for cooling or shade needs.
HeatRisk is experimental and time-sensitive, so treat it as a screening signal.
