### FEMA Repetitive Loss Areas (Advanced Risk)

This layer summarizes where multiple flood insurance claims have occurred over time.
The polygons are census block groups with aggregated repetitive-loss counts from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) public datasets.
Use this to spot neighborhoods with persistent claim activity and compare total versus unmitigated counts.
Higher counts can signal chronic flood exposure even if a parcel is outside the mapped floodplain.

- **Block groups with total RL data:** {total_count}
- **Block groups with unmitigated RL data:** {unmitigated_count}
- **Total repetitive loss claims (aggregated):** {total_rl}
- **Unmitigated repetitive loss (aggregated):** {total_unmitigated}
- **Coverage:** Public data is aggregated and partial (not parcel-specific)
