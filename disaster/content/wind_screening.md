### Wind & Hurricane Exposure (Screening Level)

This layer provides a screening-level view of historical wind exposure near the home.
The data combines National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) hurricane swaths, tracks, and tornado paths rather than design standards.
Use this to compare relative wind exposure across locations and to inform inspection priorities.
It is not a substitute for engineering-grade wind design criteria.

- **Wind exposure category:** {wind_category}
- **Hurricane-force winds recorded:** {hurricane_force}
- **Overall risk tier:** {risk_tier}
- **Data source:** {source}
- **Note:** {note}

This is a **screening-level** view based on historical National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) layers. It does
**not** represent code design wind speeds.
