### Earthquake Fault Proximity

This layer highlights mapped Quaternary fault lines near the home.
The data comes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Quaternary Faults (Qfaults) database and is represented as fault trace polylines.
Use this to compare proximity to known active faults and prioritize seismic inspections or retrofits.
No nearby fault traces found does not eliminate seismic risk.

- **Result:** No mapped Qfaults intersect within **{radius_miles} miles**
- **Coverage:** National Quaternary Faults (Qfaults) inventory (not site-specific)
- **Source:** United States Geological Survey (USGS) Qfaults (2020 release)
