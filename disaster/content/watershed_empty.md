### Watersheds (USGS HUC-12)

This layer outlines the drainage basins that control how water flows across the landscape.
The polygons are HUC-12 (Hydrologic Unit Code 12) watershed boundaries from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Watershed Boundary Dataset.
Use this to understand upstream drainage context and why nearby flood zones behave the way they do.
No watershed polygons returned may indicate limited coverage or an edge-of-dataset location.

- **Result:** No HUC-12 watersheds intersect within **{radius_miles} miles**
