### FEMA Repetitive Loss Areas (Advanced Risk)

This layer summarizes where multiple flood insurance claims have occurred over time.
The polygons are census block groups with aggregated repetitive-loss counts from Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) public datasets.
Use this to identify neighborhoods with persistent claim activity even when parcel-level data is unavailable.
If no polygons appear, it reflects limited public coverage rather than zero risk.

- **Result:** No public repetitive loss block-group polygons found within **{radius_miles} miles**
- **Coverage:** Public data is aggregated and partial (not parcel-specific)
