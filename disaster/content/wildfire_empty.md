### Historical Wildfire Context

This layer shows where large wildfires have burned within the selected radius.
The polygons are historical burn perimeters from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) / United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program, not active fire conditions.
Use this to understand prior fire activity and whether the area has recently burned.
No polygons here means no recorded large burns, not a guarantee of low risk.

- **No mapped historical wildfire perimeters** intersect the area within **{radius_miles} miles**
- This reflects **recorded large-fire history only**
- Absence of recorded perimeters does **not guarantee zero wildfire risk**
