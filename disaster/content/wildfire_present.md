### Historical Wildfire Context

This layer shows where large wildfires have burned within the selected radius.
The polygons are historical burn perimeters from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) / United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program, not active fire conditions.
Use this to understand prior fire activity and whether the area has recently burned.
It is a history signal and should be combined with current vegetation and mitigation checks.

- **Most recent recorded fire year:** {most_recent_year}
- These represent **past burned areas**, not current fire conditions
