Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) flood zones map regulatory floodplains and indicate the likelihood of inundation.
The polygons come from FEMA's National Flood Hazard Layer (NFHL) and show zones such as AE, A, VE, and X.
Use this to compare the home's zone to nearby risk areas and to anticipate insurance requirements.
Higher-risk zones typically imply stricter lending and insurance expectations.
