### Earthquake Fault Proximity

This layer highlights mapped Quaternary fault lines near the home.
The data comes from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Quaternary Faults (Qfaults) database and is represented as fault trace polylines.
Use this to compare proximity to known active faults and prioritize seismic inspections or retrofits.
Fault presence does not predict specific events but indicates regional seismic exposure.
